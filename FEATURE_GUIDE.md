# Guide: Managing the Homepage Featured Exhibits

This document provides a walkthrough of the new system for managing the featured exhibits on the homepage.

### Overview of the New "Hybrid" System

The new system is designed to be both powerful and easy to use. It combines two modes of operation:

1.  **Automatic Mode (The Default)**
    If you don't manually specify a layout, the homepage grid will automatically adapt based on the number of products you have marked as "Featured".
    *   **1 Featured Product:** Displays in a single, full-width slot.
    *   **2 Featured Products:** Display side-by-side in a 50/50 split.
    *   **3 Featured Products:** Display in a balanced three-piece layout.

2.  **Manual Override Mode**
    For full creative control, a new **Featured Exhibits Manager** allows you to manually select a specific layout template and arrange the order of your featured products. When you save a configuration in the manager, it **overrides** the automatic behavior.

### How to Use the New System: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here is the recommended workflow for managing your featured exhibits.

#### Part 1: How to Add or Remove Products from the "Featured" Pool

Controlling *which* products are considered "featured" is still done when you edit a product.

1.  Navigate to the **Inventory** tab in the admin panel.
2.  Either create a new exhibit or edit an existing one.
3.  Find the **Category** dropdown menu.
4.  To make a product available for the homepage grid, set its category to **"Featured Exhibit"**.
5.  To remove a product from the featured pool, simply change its category to something else (e.g., "Archive").
6.  Save the product.

The most recent products marked as "Featured" will be used by the automatic layout system.

#### Part 2: How to Manually Curate the Homepage Grid

When you want a specific look for your homepage, use the new manager.

1.  Navigate to the new **Featured** tab in the admin sidebar.
2.  The **Featured Exhibits Manager** will load, showing all your currently "Featured" products.
3.  **Select a Layout:** Choose from the available layout templates (e.g., "Hero", "Panorama"). The preview grid below will update to show the new structure.
4.  **Arrange the Order:** In the "Layout Preview" section, **drag and drop** the product cards to arrange them in the desired order. The first card will go in the first slot, the second in the second, and so on.
5.  **Save Your Layout:** Once you are happy with the arrangement, click the **"Save Configuration"** button.

The live homepage will immediately be updated to reflect the precise layout and order you just created.

#### Part 3: How to Return to Automatic Mode

To revert to the automatic layout behavior, you simply need to clear the manual configuration. I will add a "Reset to Automatic" button to the manager in a future update. For now, if you need to return to automatic mode, you can ask me to help reset the configuration file.
